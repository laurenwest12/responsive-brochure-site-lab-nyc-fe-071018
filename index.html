However, Sebastian gets more than he bargained for as he attempts to woo Annette into his bed.</div>

        Once the board(s) are constructed, a nonparticipating person calls out random numbers between 1 and 75. Classically, there is a bucket of numbered balls from which the leader may draw, but if those are not available, the leader can call out random numbers with their corresponding letter. Numbers and letters are called (example: B12, G51, N33) and marked off on players’ corresponding scorecards.

        Objective
            Be the first player to make a BINGO of five in a row(horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) – if you do, you win.
